# PD2 Map Making – Starting Files

This repository provides **prepared starting files for Project Diablo 2 map making**.

The intention of these files is to give you an **already set up, mostly empty map** along with all necessary edited text files, so you can immediately start creating and testing maps without having to build everything from scratch.

These files allow you to:
- Start with an empty map template
- Modify and edit map layouts easily
- Test graphics, objects, and monsters **ingame**
- Compare how assets look in the editor vs. ingame (since visuals can differ)

## 📁 Installation

1. Copy the provided **`data`** folder into your **`ProjectD2`** folder inside your Diablo II game directory.
2. Run `Game.exe` from the **ProjectD2** folder using the following launch parameters: **`-direct -txt`** (you can do this via a shortcut).

### PlugY Users
If you are using PlugY, you may need to edit the **`PlugY.ini`** file and set the launch parameters there (params).

## 🔄 Testing Ingame

Every time you want to test something ingame:

- Copy your **new or modified files** into this `data` folder
- Make sure they are placed in the **correct directory structure**

> ⚠️ Note: Your working folder (map editor workspace) is usually different from the game’s `data` folder, so manual copying is required.

## 🗺️ How to Enter the Map

1. Buy an **Identify Scroll** from any NPC.
2. Put the scroll into the **Horadric Cube**.
3. Transmute it.

This will create a **small teddy**.

4. Go to **Act 5 on Hell difficulty**.
5. Right-click the teddy (just like opening a regular map).
6. Enter the map through the **red portal**.

## 🎯 Purpose

This setup is meant as a **map-making sandbox**, giving you:
- A fast entry point into PD2 map creation
- Reliable ingame testing
- A clean foundation to build upon
- To start map making i've used the already existing "Halls of Torture" Map, that i've made -> this makes things easier to start with (item code = t17 for the map).

Happy mapping!
